    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>My project is a social media platform entitled Friendly (Friend.ly). 
	This platform will be designed for people to find friends from all over the world. 
	Current social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram are designed to mainly interact with people we already know. 
	Friendly is designed from the ground up to create an environment where people can create long lasting friendships with complete strangers, anywhere at any time. 
	This will be achieved using modern tools such as cloud technology, VR/AR, AI, and machine learning.
    </p>

    <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Motivation</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>This is an interesting project as social media is extremely popular – 59% of the world uses it (Chaffey, 2022). 
	However, on social media, not everything is all as it seems. Ironically, most “friends” that a user has on Facebook are not actually genuine friends (Newsweek, 2016). 
	This is important because loneliness and social isolation can result in mental and physical health problems (Advisory, 2022). 
	Creating a platform where genuine friendships can be cultivated is something that the world needs. 
	In the current state of the world, friendly human interaction is something that will benefit not only the lonely, but those who are tired of the toxicity of other platforms such as Twitter.
    </p>

    <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Description</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p><strong>Friendly Profiler</strong><br>
In this section, new users will enter their personal information just like any social media platform.
The Friendly Profiler will also ask about a user’s hobbies, as well as their likes and dislikes.
However, the difference with Friendly is that a personality profile is generated through a series of 30 questions developed by a psychologist.
This profile will be used to suggest new friends to find and to discover content on the platform.<br><br>
<strong>Mr. Friend</strong><br>
Mr. Friend is who everyone will interact with on the platform to experience the site.
Using AI and machine learning, he will understand how different personality types interact. Mr. Friend will suggest friends based on your personality profile, location, current friends, and previous interactions on the platform.
He will also provide content feeds based on what you are interested in, all through machine learning.<br><br>
<strong>Friendships</strong><br>
The Friendships feature is the key feature of the platform. 
The way you find a friend is based on the AI and Machine Learning technology.
You can also see what your friends are interested in and view a content feed based on their interests.
Friendships are designed to be organic – based on mutual interests and not on the location that you are in.
You receive badges and perks based on how long your friendships are on the site, and how much interaction you do across the platform with your friends.<br><br>
<strong>Enjoy</strong><br>
Enjoy is the area of the platform where users can unite under similar interests.
Using the personality profile for each user, the AI suggests areas of interest to users such as music, sport, or technology.
Then, under each category of interest, the user is given opportunities to “enjoy” these categories with someone from their Friendships list, or to meet new friends who share a similar interest.
This can involve for example, watching a live sporting event together on the platform.
Or, if they shared an interest in a particular genre of music, they could listen to a newly released album together.<br><br>
<strong>Sensations</strong><br>
In Sensations, the experience is completely tailored to users without any input.
This will then create a custom content feed based on what the AI believes the user will be interested in.
In Sensations, you view the most popular content on the platform – this can be videos/images/news etc.
Whoever shares the most popular content, receives advertising revenue based on how many hits their posts receive.<br><br>
<strong>Smile</strong><br>
An important element of the Friendly platform is the VR/AR feature entitled Smile.
This is where friends can meet in virtual rooms and interact with each other in virtual and augmented reality.
Users can meet in various places around the world that have been developed based on real world locales.
With the mobile app, the augmented reality can be used wherever a user goes.
Smile can be used for significant events such as birthdays and public holidays such as Australia Day.
For example, users can invite friends from all over the world for their virtual birthday.<br><br>
<strong>Gathering</strong><br>
Gathering is where your friends can meet via group/video chat.
The key feature is that when you are in a group chat/video, your friends can introduce other friends with the press of a button.
There is flexibility in this feature, as they can pivot straight into Smile and turn their group/video chat into a VR/AR experience, and vice versa.

    <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
•	Hybrid cloud hosting for the platform will be implemented, utilising both a public and private cloud platform.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be the public cloud platform and the private platform will be developed in-house.
Using a hybrid cloud platform ensures that the system is more cost-effective, flexible, scalable, and secure (Lucidchart.com, 2022).<br>
•	Akamai will be used as the CDN provider and the CDN platform will be Akamai Intelligent Edge. The CDN will be used for caching data to provide faster access to content across the world.<br>
•	The web servers in the data centres will be running Linux and Apache and there will be a range of MySQL database servers to store the data.<br>
•	The mobile app will be coded in Java for Android and Swift for iOS.<br>
•	The website (Friend.ly) will be developed in the front-end with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For the back-end there will be C, C++, Java, PHP, and Python.<br>
•	The VR/AR system will be coded in Unity.

    <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Skills Required</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>
•	The Chief Information Officer will manage the IT infrastructure and Chief Technology Officer will manage the business’s technology infrastructure.<br>
•	Project managers will ensure that the project is designed and implemented according to specifications. IT analysts will ensure business requirements are met.<br>
•	User experience designers will create the overall visual design and user experience. Graphic designers will create the various visual elements.<br>
•	Software developers will create the mobile apps and VR/AR platform and software testers will ensure that the software works as intended.<br>
•	Web architects and developers will design and create the website, while webmasters will maintain the website.<br>
•	Programmers will code the mobile apps, website, and various software. Quality assurance engineers will test the code to ensure it is free of bugs.<br>
•	Data centre managers and engineers will manage and maintain the data centres.<br>
•	Server architects will develop the web servers for the private cloud platform. Server administrators will oversee the running of the servers.<br>
•	Server engineers and network engineers will be at the data centres and offsite to maintain the servers, cloud, and network infrastructure respectively.<br>
•	Software engineers will develop and maintain the back-end systems and infrastructure.<br>
•	AI and machine learning scientists and engineers will develop and maintain the AI and machine learning systems.<br>
•	Cloud architects will create the cloud platform, cloud administrators will manage the cloud, and cloud engineers will maintain it.<br>
•	Backup administrators and engineers will ensure that the server data is regularly backed up in case of storage failure.<br>
•	Storage administrators and engineers will manage and maintain the storage in the data centres.<br>
•	Database administrators and engineers will ensure that the databases are administered and maintained.<br>
•	Security architects will implement the security architecture, while security and privacy analysts/engineers ensure that personal data is kept secure and private.<br>
•	This is all very feasible as there are currently many social media platforms in use, and these roles are common in the current IT market. For example, Facebook also have their own data centres, cloud platform and VR/AR implementation.

    <h2 class="w3-text-grey">Outcome</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>The outcome will be that there will be a social media platform available where people can develop genuine friendships. 
	Friendly is a space on the internet where people can cordially interact in a safe environment and bond over similar interests. 
	This will solve the problem of loneliness and isolation that so many people experience, especially in a world where human interaction is becoming less frequent. 
	This impact will be widespread, as social media use is so prevalent across the board.
